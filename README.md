# Checkers
First attempt at coding checkers. Dont like the way I handle movement and other things in multiple classes. Also not fully functioning due to the way I programmed it (players can only move once per turn instead of being able to jump over two pieces in one turn, need to force players to "kill" opponent's piece if it can, etc.). Will attempt again with better planning beforehand.
